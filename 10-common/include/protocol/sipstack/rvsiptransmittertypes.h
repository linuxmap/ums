/* RvSipTransmitterState
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The Transmitter state machine represents the state of the transmitter 
 * in the message sending activity. The RvSipTransmitterStateChangedEv() 
 * callback reports transmitter state changes and state change reasons. 
 * The state change reason indicates the reason for the
 * new state of the transmitter. 
 * The transmitter associates with the following states:
 * 
 * RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_STATE_UNDEFINED
 * Indicates that the transmitter was not yet initialized.
 * 
 * RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_STATE_IDLE
 * The initial state of the transmitter. Upon transmitter creation, the transmitter
 * assumes the IDLE state. It remains in this state until
 * RvSipTransmitterSendMessage() is called. The transmitter then moves to the
 * RESOLVING_ADDR state and starts the address resolution process.
 * 
 * RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_STATE_RESOLVING_ADDR
 * Indicates that the transmitter is about to start the address resolution process.
 * After RvSipTransmitterSendMessage() is called, the transmitter copies the
 * supplied message object and moves to the RESOLVING_ADDR state. The
 * transmitter then uses RFC 3261 rules to get the remote URI from the message
 * object, and the procedures of RFC 3263 to resolve the address by querying the
 * DNS server. When the DNS procedure is completed and the destination address
 * is determined, the transmitter moves to the FINAL_DEST_RESOLVED state.
 * 
 * RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_STATE_FINAL_DEST_RESOLVED
 * Indicates that the transmitter has completed the address resolution process and
 * that it has a destination address to use. The application can use the
 * RvSipTransmitterGetDestAddress() function to get the destination address. The
 * application can change the destination address using the
 * RvSipTransmitterSetDestAddress() function. If the application did not set the
 * Fix Via flag, the FINAL_DEST_RESOLVED state is the last chance for the
 * application to fix the Via by itself before the message is sent.
 * In this state, the application can hold the message sending activity by calling the
 * RvSipTransmitterHoldSending() function. If so, the transmitter will move to the
 * ON_HOLD state. Otherwise, the message will be sent when the state changed
 * callback returns.
 * 
 * RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_STATE_ON_HOLD
 * The transmitter assumes the ON_HOLD state if the
 * RvSipTransmitterHoldSending() function is called in the
 * FINAL_DEST_RESOLVED state. The application should call this function if it
 * wishes to manipulate the transmitter destination address and DNS list before the
 * message is sent. In this state, the application can use the
 * RvSipTransmitterSetDestAddress() function to change the current destination
 * address or it can supply NULL values to this function and reset the destination
 * address. The application can also manipulate the DNS list that contains the rest
 * of the DNS results. Resetting the destination address will cause the transmitter
 * to return to its DNS list for further address resolution.
 * To continue the sending activities, the application must call the
 * RvSipTransmitterResumeSending() function. If the transmitter has a valid
 * destination address, it will continue with the message sending and proceed to the
 * READY_FOR_SENDING state. Otherwise the transmitter will return to the
 * RESOLVING_ADDR state.
 * 
 * RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_STATE_READY_FOR_SENDING
 * Indicates that the transmitter is ready to send the message to the remote party.
 * The message in this state has its final format, and the application should no
 * longer change the message content or remote address. This state is informative
 * only.
 * 
 * RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_STATE_NEW_CONN_IN_USE
 * Indicates that the transmitter is about to use a new connection. The connection
 * can be a totally new connection created by the transmitter object or a connection
 * that the transmitter found in the connection hash. In both cases the pExtraInfo
 * will hold a pointer to a structure of type
 * RvSipTransmitterNewConnInUseStateInfo that includes the connection handle.
 * Two reasons are associated with this state:
 *    RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_REASON_NEW_CONN_CREATED 
 *         indicates that the transmitter created a new connection.
 *        
 *   RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_REASON_CONN_FOUND_IN_HASH
 *         indicates that the transmitter found an existing
 *         connection in the connection hash and that the transmitter is
 *         about to use the connection.
 * 
 * 
 * RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_STATE_MSG_SENT
 * Indicates that the message was sent successfully to the remote party. This state
 * does not supply the message object. The message is most likely destructed when
 * this state is reached. This state is also an indication that the application should
 * now terminate the transmitter object that has completed all its tasks and cannot
 * be used any longer.
 * 
 * RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_STATE_MSG_SEND_FAILURE
 * Indicates that an error occurred and the transmitter will not be able to send the
 * message. The state change reason indicates the type of failure. The following
 * reasons are associated with this state:
 *    RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_REASON_UNDEFINED 
 *         a general error caused the failure.
 *     RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_REASON_NETWORK_ERROR
 *         a network error occurred while trying to send the request or
 *         during the DNS procedure.
 *     RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_REASON_CONNECTION_ERROR
 *         An error occurred on the connection that was used to send the
 *         message.
 *     RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_REASON_OUT_OF_RESOURCES 
 *         The message cannot be sent because of a lack of resources.
 * In the message send failure, the application can do one of two things:
 *     * Terminate the transmitter using the
 *       RvSipTransmitterTerminate() function.
 *     * Send the message again to the next address in the DNS list by
 *       calling the RvSipTransmitterSendMessage() function. This
 *       option is available only if the enhanced DNS feature is enabled.
